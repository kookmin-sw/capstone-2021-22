Running the script:
python3 main.py -i <input_path> -o <output_path> -m <model_type> -prep <preprocessing_method> -postp <postprocessing_method>
Explanation of args:
-i <input_path> - path to input file or dir.
-o <output_path> - path to output file or dir.
-prep <preprocessing_method> - Preprocessing method. Can be {} . `bbd-fastrcnn` is better to use.
-postp <postprocessing_method> - Postprocessing method. Can be {} . `rtb-bnb` is better to use.
-m <model_type> - can be {}. u2net is better to use. 
DeepLab models (xception_model or mobile_net_model) are outdated 
and designed to remove the background from PORTRAIT photos or PHOTOS WITH ANIMALS!
